It targets your quads, glutes, hamstrings, and core simultaneously. Start by standing with feet shoulder-width apart, then lower your hips as if sitting into a chair. Coach Timlen tells beginners to focus on keeping their chest up and their weight in their heels. Aim for 3 sets of 12 to 15 repetitions to build a solid foundation."}],["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-[#39FF14] mt-8 mb-4 uppercase","children":"2.

The key is maintaining a straight line from head to heels throughout the movement."}],["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-[#39FF14] mt-8 mb-4 uppercase","children":"3.
